# My_42_piscine
You will find here the days I coded during my 42 piscine. I had no time to finish them all, however, all work presented here has been Moulinette approved.

This is a no-cheat zone, so if you are a piscineu or a piscineuse, play by the rule and don't peek, you will find it much more rewarding.

-Rush00 works perfectly and we earned the bonus points. Grade is 116%.

-Rush01 wasn't finished, I did not uploaded it.

-Rush02 is 100% functional and was graded 105%.

I have included the pdf for convenience, I did not write them and have no rights over these files. I will remove them if such a request were to be made by the owner.
